### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

- Fetch
- ES6 Modules

### What I learned

I learned more about API calls using fetch.

### Continued development

Consuming APIs is something very common in the world of web development, so i want to keep mastering the different ways to fetch data from an API, along with the options that might have the documentation.
